The payload for this advice is one or more JSONPaths; either a single path, or a JSON Array of JSON Strings containing the paths. Each path represents the attributes of the response body which are to be returned to the requester; attributes which are not specified are removed. If an attribute is selected, this also implies that all its ancestors are selected. A single JSONPath may represent multiple attributes; all of them will be included. If multiple instances of Include Attribute Advice are returned from policy, they are combined such that the union of all attributes selected will be included in the response. NOTE: This advice cannot be applied directly to a SCIM search."
